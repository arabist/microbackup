Modern states do not originate only from nationalism. Abdullah II’s remarks at the Jordan River evoke Islam as a principle of government and Muslim rulers as protectors of Christians. This use of Islam is very different from what we usually hear about religion in the Middle East – for instance, ‘sectarianism’ (religion-based claims to institutionalised representation within nation states, often erupting in violence) or the fascist brutality of ISIS. But neither should we follow the king of Jordan into a monarchist-nationalist nostalgia. His great-great-grandfather Hussein was not born a nationalist. Here, I tell Hussein’s story as an exercise in unearthing ideas about Muslim government that we can call ‘imperial’. This is important because the imperial techniques of state-making defined the early 20th century in many regions of the world, and not nationalist or egalitarian revolutions.</blockquote>\n",

As the post-cold war age of America as a sole superpower fades, the old era when countries had to choose from a prix fixe menu of alliances is shifting into a more fluid order. The stand-off between Washington and Beijing, and the west’s effective abandonment of its three-decade dream that the gospel of free markets would lead to a more liberal version of the Chinese Communist party, are presenting an opportunity for much of the world: not just to be wooed but also to play one off against the other — and many are doing this with alacrity and increasing skill.</blockquote>\n",

The concept is vague (when is Macron not vague and trying to have his cake and eat it too?) but suggests the idea that France should play a balancing role in great-power competition. And this conservative, almost passive view is what is being criticized here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Je crains cependant qu’en généralisant le concept d’équilibre et en en faisant un principe d’action nous ne reprenions une tendance ancienne de notre diplomatie qui ne nous a pas servis dans le passé. C’est la vision conservatrice d’un monde où la priorité est de préserver les équilibres du moment, quels qu’ils soient, vision inspirée par la conviction que tout changement est par nature dangereux.</p>\n<p>. . .</p>\n<p>S’il est une certitude dans notre monde incertain, c’est que nous sommes au début de changements profonds, non à leur conclusion. La France n’a certainement pas les moyens de les arrêter, et dans un monde qui bouge, la seule chance de peser sur les événements est de les accompagner en se fixant quelques objectifs essentiels.

The concept is vague (when is Macron not vague and trying to have his cake and eat it too?) but suggests the idea that France should play a balancing role in great-power competition. And this conservative, almost passive view is what is being criticized here:\r\n\r\n> Je crains cependant qu’en généralisant le concept d’équilibre et en en faisant un principe d’action nous ne reprenions une tendance ancienne de notre diplomatie qui ne nous a pas servis dans le passé.
