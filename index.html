<p>Writing in <em>Le Monde</em>, Jean-Pierre Filiu outlines the separatist strategy of the UAE in Libya, Yemen and Sudan where it has backed violent factions with local agendas that undermine any possibility of national reconciliation and stability: Haftar and the east in Libya, southern separatists in Aden, and of course the genocidal Darfur militias (chiefly the RSF). Translation by AI (Claude):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Sparta of the Middle East,&rdquo; as the United Arab Emirates has sometimes been described, has distinguished itself for more than a decade through a highly militarized and particularly aggressive foreign policy. Such a strategy bears the mark of Mohammed Bin Zayed, the current president of the federation of emirates, and is driven by an obsessive hostility toward the &ldquo;Arab Spring,&rdquo; that wave of popular protest that made the dictatorships of the region tremble in 2011.</p>
<p>While the strength of such a strategy may lie in its counter-revolutionary coherence, it leads the United Arab Emirates to support secessionist movements in numerous theaters, accentuating the fragmentation of the concerned states instead of guaranteeing some form of authoritarian restoration.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>The Sudanese tragedy thus brings to a climax the disaster that the UAE&rsquo;s separatist strategy represents in terms of mass suffering for the populations concerned and the disintegration of the regional order.</p>

<p>Scathing new documentary on settler violence in the Palestinian Occupied Territories. Theroux writes about the filming <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/louis-theroux-the-settlers-guest-column-1236370743/">here for  Deadline</a>, ending with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of my reasons for wanting to go back, apart from changes in the region itself, was the sense that increasingly the wider world was looking to what is happening in Israel and the occupied territories for clues as to what their own future might look like. Some global populist leaders view the ideology of the settler community as a prototype for a type of nationalism they would like to practise. They regard Israeli settlers as the tip of the spear of what they frame as a global war against Islam. The views expressed by some in the film are part of a much wider and increasingly powerful anti-democratic strain of thinking that is pushing back against notions of civil rights and the rule of law. And so there is renewed relevance to understanding what is happening in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Mike Stone and Marisa Taylor report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX and two partners have emerged as frontrunners to win a crucial part of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Dome&rdquo; missile defense shield, six people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Musk&rsquo;s rocket and satellite company is partnering with software maker Palantir (PLTR.O), opens new tab and drone builder Anduril on a bid to build key parts of Golden Dome, the sources said, which has drawn significant interest from the technology sector&rsquo;s burgeoning base of defense startups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is the icing on the cake for the defense tech bros who hate big government except when it gives them big contracts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an unusual twist, SpaceX has proposed setting up its role in Golden Dome as a &ldquo;subscription service&rdquo; in which the government would pay for access to the technology, rather than own the system outright.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jordanian authorities said the newer plot included plans to manufacture missiles locally as well as bring them in from abroad, and to obtain explosives and weapons. The plot also included “concealment of a ready-to-use missile, a project to manufacture drones, and the recruitment and training of individuals within the Kingdom and their subsequent training abroad,” the statement said.</p>
<p>A report by the Reuters news agency cited officials saying that the arrests on Tuesday were connected to the Palestinian militant group, Hamas. Since the war between Israel and Hamas began in Gaza, Jordan has countered Iranian efforts to smuggle weapons through the country to Palestinian militants across the border in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to regional and U.S. officials.</p>

And they certainly won’t be retiring even after quashing their woke and ESG-loving enemies. In Trump’s Washington, they arrive not as guests but as architects. Their reality-bending machinery—money hydraulics, platform dominance, bureaucracies kneeling to translate private fantasy into public policy—wields unprecedented force. Carnegie and Rockefeller commanded respect but lacked this lethal arsenal: social media thunderbox, celebrity aura, venture capital chainsaw, West Wing passkey. By rewriting regulations, channeling subsidies, and recalibrating public expectations, oligarch-intellectuals transmute fever dreams—blockchain fiefdoms, Martian homesteads—into seemingly plausible futures.</p>

<p>Would the Islamist rebels who ousted the strongman Bashar al-Assad in December ban pork and alcohol, impose modest dress on women or limit Christian worship? Would the new security forces protect Christians from attacks by Muslim extremists?</p>
<p>“Nothing has happened that makes you feel that things are better,” said Mirna Haddad, one of the churchgoers.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the historic town of Maaloula, its Muslim minority had different concerns. Like their Christian neighbors, they had fled their homes here early in Syria’s 13-year civil war. But unlike the Christians, they had been barred from returning by the Assad regime and a Christian militia it supported.</p>
<p>“The problem is the majority,” meaning the town’s Christians, said Omar Ibrahim Omar, the leader of a new local security committee. He had come home to Maaloula only after Mr. al-Assad’s fall, after being kept out for more than a decade.</p>
<p>“We won’t let that happen again,” he said.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>From the latest issue of the excellent newsletter <em>Syria in Transition</em>, <a href="https://www.syriaintransition.com/thenewumayyads">The New Umayyads</a>,  on Ahmed Sharaa&rsquo;s vision of a <em>kayan sunni</em> or &ldquo;sunni entity&rdquo; as a governing principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one principal problem: the 25 per cent of Syria that is not Sunni (or Arab). Alawites, Kurds, Druze, Christians, Turkmans, Circassians and Ismailis would be unlikely to accept being bit-players in a state whose identity, strategic posture, and socio-economic interests ran counter to theirs. A solution, from Sharaa’s perspective, could be a form of soft federalism – a loosely decentralised arrangement that accommodated minority demands while allowing the Sunni core to assert political and ideological dominance.</p>
<p>While official talk of the <em>kayan sunni</em> remains muted due to its politically charged connotations, a more palatable alternative has been offered to the Syrian public: “Umayyadism.” Promoted by Sharaa’s close advisers and amplified by loyal social media influencers, this nostalgic concept draws on the legacy of the early Islamic Umayyad caliphate as a vision of national revival, prosperity, and restored grandeur. </p>
<p>During its 89-year reign, the Umayyad dynasty ruled an empire stretching from North Africa to the Caucasus and Central Asia, with Damascus as its imperial capital. It later established itself in Spain where it ruled from Cordoba for 275 years. A worldly and pragmatic dynasty, the Umayyads adapted and refined Byzantine models of political administration and were generally tolerant of Jews and Christians. But the symbolism runs deeper: the Umayyads were historic adversaries of the Shia. Their second caliph was responsible for the killing of the Prophet’s grandson, Hussein, and their policies heavily discriminated against Persians. In resurrecting the Umayyads, Sharaa’s circle invokes not only imperial grandeur but also a pointed reminder of Sunni supremacy over Persia and Shia Islam. </p>
<p>Pro-government media personality Musa al-Omar (685,000 followers on X) posted on his socials on 19 February a video of Sharaa riding a horse to a song whose opening line was: “The Umayyads are of golden lineage / their name sent fear in Persian kings / books cannot praise them enough.” </p>
<p>When Sharaa visited King Abdullah II in Jordan on 26 February, “The Umayyads meet the Hashemites” was the main tag line of HTS-run social media accounts.</p>

			 <p>Robert Armstrong, writing with clarity in the FT about Trumponomics: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/096c48e9-a449-44d7-a280-bf9b5d25b211">The tariff crisis is not existential</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The picture is simple: the Trump administration’s economic policymaking has been unpredictable and incompetent at a moment where high deficits and lingering inflation worries mean there is no room for amateurism. Yields are likely to remain volatile. Global investors are responding to this fact by demanding higher yields for owning Treasuries. The sell-off of Treasuries has pulled the dollar down. All of this has been amplified by the reversal of highly leveraged hedge fund trades that are no longer tenable in a high volatility environment.</p>
<p>This feels momentous, because the reliability of the dollar and Treasuries are the foundation of just about every global market. If things don’t get better soon, who knows what might happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For all their missteps, the students drew attention to matters that seemed to elude their detractors: the obscenity of Israel’s war on Gaza; the complicity of their government in arming Israel and facilitating the slaughter; the hypocrisy of America’s claim to defend human rights and a rules-based international order while giving Israel carte blanche; and the urgent need for a ceasefire. Nor were they cowed by Netanyahu’s grotesque comparison of the protests to anti-Jewish mobilisations in German universities in the 1930s (where no one was holding seders). If Trump wins they will be blamed, along with Arab and Muslim voters who can’t bring themselves to vote for a president who armed Bibi, but they deserve credit for mobilising support for a ceasefire and for helping to shift the narrative on Palestine.</p>
<p>The destruction of Gaza will be as formative for them as the struggles against the Vietnam War, apartheid in South Africa and the Iraq War were for earlier generations. Their image of a child murdered by a genocidal state will not be Anne Frank but Hind Rajab, the six-year-old girl killed by Israeli tank fire as she sat in a car pleading for help, surrounded by the bodies of her murdered relatives. When they chant ‘We are all Palestinians,’ they are moved by the same feeling of solidarity that led students in 1968 to chant ‘Nous sommes tous des juifs allemands’ after the German-Jewish student leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit was expelled from France. These are emotions of which no group of victims can forever remain the privileged beneficiary, not even the descendants of the European Jews who perished in the death camps.</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="https://newscorp.com/2024/05/22/news-corp-and-openai-sign-landmark-multi-year-global-partnership/">OpenAI announced a five-year deal</a> to license content from News Corp.&rsquo;s outlets to train AI. It&rsquo;s the latest in a series of deals with establishment outlets whose politics range from center-left to center-right, including the Associated Press, Politico and Business Insider owner Axel Springer, and the Financial Times.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But while some on the left groused that the News Corp. package includes the right-leaning tabloid New York Post, the true impact of the new marriage of AI and news appears to be the revenge of the establishment media. And fringier, more explicitly ideological outlets on the right have noticed that their businesses &ndash; already rocked by an industry-wide decline in web traffic &ndash; seem unlikely to get an AI bailout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that publishing empires like Axel Springer and News Corp. actually are pretty right-wing and have an overlap with the &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; right-wing media that has been growing in recent years (I mean where did people like Tucker Carlson emerge from?) The FT is probably the most left of those cited above and that&rsquo;s a newspaper for the business elite owned by Nikkei, the voice of the Japanese corporate establishment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Atlanticist is a special species of Western liberal who sees the world order as an American-led, European-assisted project that requires hard-nosed dealing with the rest of the globe, which must, whether through entreaties or force, hegemony or domination, be kept in its place. For Atlanticists, “credibility” is a word to conjure with. It means staying the course in whatever quagmire they have made—from Vietnam to Afghanistan—the idea being that rival powers will take this as a sign of steadfastness rather than the hubris of an elite that diagnoses its own citizenry’s aversion to wars abroad as a form of populist disease. Though Atlanticism began its life as Anglo-Saxonism—and the U.S.-U.K. relationship remains its kernel—its most pungent variants, and the fervor of the converted, are found in Central and Eastern Europe. The arteries of Atlanticism run across the Continent in the form of NATO academies, John F. Kennedy Avenues, and the Amerikahäuser in German cities, where you can check out a biography of Davy Crockett or The Great Depression for Dummies and gaze on the walls at posters of national parks. The Munich Conference itself is only one among a galaxy of Atlanticist institutions—the German Marshall Fund, the Federal Academy for Security Policy, the Atlantic Council, the Atlantic Initiative, the Deutsche Atlantische Gesellschaft, the Atlantic Brücke—all of which tug hard to forestall the expiry date of a worldview that has seen better days.</p>

<p>Now is the time for the United States, and in its wake the international community, to make a decision: Will the endless cycle of violence between Israel and the Palestinians continue, or are we going to try to put a stop to it? Will the United States continue to arm Israel and then bemoan the excessive use of these armaments, or is it finally prepared to take real steps, for the first time in its history, to change reality? And above all, will the cruelest Israeli attack on Gaza become the most pointless of all, or will the opportunity that came in its aftermath not be missed, for a change?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sudan’s​ capital, Khartoum, is being destroyed in a fight to the death between two venal, brutal generals. This is a war of choice; allowing it to happen was a failure of international diplomacy. But if we look at the city’s 200-year history, the fighting shouldn’t be a surprise. Khartoum was founded on a command post built for the purposes of imperial robbery – and every subsequent regime has continued this practice. In ordinary circumstances, Sudan is run by a cabal of merchants and generals who plunder the darker-skinned people of the marchlands and bring their wealth to Khartoum, a relatively opulent city and a haven of calm. But the logic of kleptocracy is inexorable: when the cartel is bankrupt, the mobsters shoot it out. We saw this in Liberia and Somalia thirty years ago. The ransack of the Sudanese state today is ten times bigger.</p>

<p>The result has been a tug-of-war between Erdoğan’s governing coalition and the nominally social democratic opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) over the fate of Turkey’s Syrian community. Both parties are openly competing to see who can promise to crack down harder on immigration and swiftly restore relations with Assad. When Turkey heads to the polls on Sunday the Syrian community is poised to endure loss no matter who wins.</p>

<p>Until last year, it was never clear where Mr. Marcos personally stood on the United States, given his family’s history. But by inclination and background, he has demonstrated that he is pro-Western in his leanings. He went to Oxford University in England. He enjoys watching Formula 1 and loves rock music, particularly Eric Clapton and the Beatles. He also loves cooking for his family and makes a mean gumbo, according to Matthew Marcos Manotoc, Mr. Marcos’s nephew and the governor of Ilocos Norte, the stronghold of the Marcos family.</p>

<p>From an anonymous essay on a devastated Syria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hadn’t been to Syria in years, and what I now saw left me wondering how people were getting by and managing their affairs, given the inflation and corruption and lack of opportunity to make an honest — or even a decent — living. This was a country in postwar freefall, where the victor had no virtue and the victim was all but forgotten; a country still fractured, a people condemned to live at the mercy of the elements, the earthquakes and the occasional Assad and Russian airstrikes that continue up north, or to live in the shadow of international sanctions that cripple the parts of the country that are firmly in Assad’s grip. In the absence of something like a Marshall Plan to rebuild what has been destroyed (mostly by the Assad regime and the Russians), what seems to keep Syrians hopeful is some patched-together idea of moving forward to something that resembles the past, but worse.</p>

<p>Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, writing in <em>Foreign Affairs</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given that economic restrictions will remain the centerpiece of Western policy toward Iran, activists inside and outside the country must help craft more sophisticated sanctions policies, with the goal of restoring the political power of the Iranian people. The United States and the European Union should retool their current restrictions, which make it hard for Iranians to receive remittances, make it very difficult for Western businesses to hire Iranian freelancers, and make it nearly impossible for anyone other than Iran’s richest citizens to store their money abroad. Opening new financial channels while keeping others closed would allow Western policymakers to move beyond the failed paradigm of maximum pressure and instead adopt a kind of calibrated pressure. In doing so, they would account for the important connections between the economic resources available to households and the political power of ordinary people.</p>

<p>My former boss Jean-Marie Guéhenno has a thoughtful op-ed on Macron&rsquo;s new foreign policy principle - the ambition that France should be a &ldquo;<em>puissance d’équilibres</em>&rdquo; which might be translated as &ldquo;power of equilibriums&rdquo; or &ldquo;balancing power&rdquo;. The concept is vague (when is Macron not vague and trying to have his cake and eat it too?) but suggests the idea that France should play a balancing role in great-power competition. And this conservative, almost passive view is what is being criticized here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Je crains cependant qu’en généralisant le concept d’équilibre et en en faisant un principe d’action nous ne reprenions une tendance ancienne de notre diplomatie qui ne nous a pas servis dans le passé. C’est la vision conservatrice d’un monde où la priorité est de préserver les équilibres du moment, quels qu’ils soient, vision inspirée par la conviction que tout changement est par nature dangereux.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>S’il est une certitude dans notre monde incertain, c’est que nous sommes au début de changements profonds, non à leur conclusion. La France n’a certainement pas les moyens de les arrêter, et dans un monde qui bouge, la seule chance de peser sur les événements est de les accompagner en se fixant quelques objectifs essentiels. Le monde est en déséquilibre(s), et ces déséquilibres sont porteurs de risques mais aussi d’opportunités : une diplomatie dynamique devrait plutôt chercher à les anticiper pour s’y adapter qu’avoir la prétention de les arrêter afin de créer un nouvel et illusoire « équilibre ».</p>

<p>Tarek Megeresi, in a policy brief for ECFR that neatly summarizes the sad situation in Tunisia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saied’s rule is inflicting deep damage on Tunisia’s social stability, economic prospects, and democratic freedoms and culture. He appears unable to set strategy or take decisions that measure up to the crisis the country is undergoing. The president is exacerbating matters by focusing his attention on silencing critics and eroding democratic freedoms, and he is failing to rise to the occasion on the international stage by providing confidence in his leadership.</p>

<p>From the conclusion of this fine piece by Fanar Haddad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The prospect of perpetual protest, both elite-driven and popular, alongside persistent state failure is a damning indictment of the post-2003 state-building enterprise. It recalls former Finance Minister Ali Allawi’s summation of the Iraqi state in his lengthy resignation letter of 2022. He describes a state that exists in form but not in substance, one that is capable of recreating itself despite its numerous contradictions. It is these contradictions, underpinning the hybridity, the opacity and the dysfunction of the system, that paradoxically lend it resilience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All the calls for reform are stymied by the political framework of this country… It has allowed for the state’s capture by outside interest groups. Unlike human beings, states do not die in a definitive way. They could linger on as zombie states . . . the machinery of government continues, it is true, and the trappings of state power persist, but there is no substance to the form.</em></p>

<p>Gideon Levy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A family is informed that their son has fallen in battle. Another family, from the same community, is informed that their son has been wounded and captured, and is now lying in the enemy’s hospital beyond the border. For over a month, this family has tried to visit their son, while the other family grieves over the death of its loved one, whose place of burial is unknown. Ultimately, the anticipated permit arrives and the mother travels to visit her wounded son. As soon as she enters his hospital room, her world collapses: The young man in the bed is not her son. He is the son of her neighbors who was believed to have died. The 40 days of ritual mourning have elapsed in any case.</p>
<p>This is what happened in recent weeks at Aqabat Jabr refugee camp, located on the outskirts of Jericho. Tayer Aweidat was declared dead; Alaa Aweidat was said to have been wounded. When the mother, Nawal, came to Jerusalem’s Hadassah Hospital to visit her son, after a month of trying to obtain a permit, she was astonished to find a wounded man who was not her son. Since then, she and her family have been beside themselves. They want to know only one thing: What happened to their son?</p>
<p>The state actually replied: “The relevant person is apparently no longer alive and his body is being kept at the National Center of Forensic Medicine. … That ends our involvement,” wrote attorney Matanya Rosin, a deputy in the State Prosecutor’s Office, High Court of Justice department. The attorney was resolute: The son is “apparently” dead and that was “the end of our involvement.” That’s enough information for you subhumans, continue living with your doubts and don’t dare bother us again. The attorney also informed the family, with the humanity that so characterizes our enlightened country, that the family can go to the forensic institute to identify what is supposedly the body of their son.</p>

<p>Shadi Hamid, writing for Brookings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, the PJD, despite its success or perhaps because of it, is one of the region’s weakest Islamist parties (at least in electoral terms). Before the Arab Spring, it lost on purpose. After the Arab Spring, it lost by winning. This means that, for the time being, the monarchy has succeeded not only in neutralizing the country’s largest political party but rendered it irrelevant. The PJD was a useful buffer because it could provide the illusion of democratic progress without the substance. What happens, though, when the illusion is revealed for what it is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a serviceable account of the PJD&rsquo;s rise and fall since the late 2000s, but overall it focuses too much on the constraints the party faced in its strategy of cooptation/competition with the palace (in which, as Hamid writes, it could never win, just steadily attempt to make gains to constrain the room for maneuver of palace) and not enough on the context.</p>
<p>For instance, the PJD&rsquo;s setbacks cannot only be ascribed to its relationship with the palace, but also several other important contextual factors. One is the changing regional geopolitical configuration and especially the anti-Islamist authoritarian counter-revolution led by two key Arab allies of Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates after the 2013 coup in Egypt and more or less supported by its two key Western allies, France and the US. Another is the PJD&rsquo;s own internal challenges, ranging from rivalry from other Islamist movements (especially Adl Wa al-Ihsan, numerically the largest Islamist movement in the country and the most engaged on Palestine, and the Salafi movement, which was particularly energized over the Syrian uprising) to the diminishing returns it could offer to its cadres and electoral base despite the opportunities to hold elected office and posts in the civil service. Finally, the piece ignores a clever electoral strategy in the last election by parties close to the palace such as the RNI that both appealed to the PJD&rsquo;s sociological base (on non-religious grounds), revived traditional networks of support among local notables and of course benefited from vast amounts of funding and the tacit support of the interior ministry.</p>
<p>In short, Hamid is too reductionist here in viewing the PJD&rsquo;s fate as driven mostly by its relationship with the palace, as vitally important as that is, and by being forced to renounce its ideological agenda on Palestine or religion in the public sphere. I&rsquo;d argue it is just as important to understand the sociological gambit of the PJD as a representative of social classes (mostly lower middle class) that saw it as a vehicle for greater representation, cultural influence and economic access in a highly closed and elitist system. In authoritarian states that have semi-competitive political arenas like Morocco, the paradox is that the &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; components of politics has both real and fake aspects. They are dynamic and can be influenced by multiple factors – to reduce things to the palace and the rest is ultimately misleading.</p>

<p>Fascinating story on a quietist and quietly influential religious movement in Syria, by Laila Alrefaai and Obayda Amer in <em>Newlines</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Qubaysiyat have been a secretive, at times underground, revivalist Islamic movement. The group has focused on promoting conservative religious education alongside the secular curriculum taught throughout Syria’s public school system. At first, it did so through underground cells, teaching “lessons” in private homes. But since the early 2000s, when Bashar al-Assad came to power and loosened the country’s restrictions on private schools and colleges, educational institutions run or influenced by the Qubaysiyat have become ubiquitous in Syria, often recognizable by their female teachers, who wear distinctive navy veils. The movement remains largely unknown to the broader world, yet it is believed to boast tens of thousands — if not hundreds of thousands — of disciples within Syria, as well as in franchises across the Middle East and even as far afield as Europe and the Americas. At the center of it all has been the towering figure of al-Qubaysi, a woman as influential within the group as she has been mysterious.</p>
